# Generative Design — To Do

## Background

The non-brand academic baseline is done. The site is calm, typographically-led, and deployable. The generative design spike is the next phase: create design branches from `gendes-academia`, give each one a mood board and brief, explore distinct visual directions, and evaluate what sticks.

Read `docs/gendes.md` for the full methodology. Read `docs/visual-design.md` for the baseline this work forks from. Create the design branch first, then fill `docs/gendes-brief.md` and `docs/gendes-moodboard/<branch-name>/` before handing that branch to an implementation agent.

---

## General Principles

- Each design branch is a branch off `gendes-academia`. Branches are cheap. Commitment to a direction is how you learn whether it works.
- A design branch runs locally in SSR — not a screenshot, not a Figma mockup — to be evaluated properly. One shared Docker CMS stack can serve all branches; switch branches in the same repo by default.
- A `git worktree` workflow is optional if separate folders become useful for comparing branches. It is not required for the first pass.
- Stabilize enough content model work before running the first design branch so it designs against real page structures, not placeholders.
- Preserve the transition system hooks, content-flow grid, and block rendering architecture in every design branch. The constraints are not negotiable.
- Accessibility does not get deferred to post-branch cleanup. If a direction introduces contrast failures or broken focus states, fix them before calling that branch a candidate.
- Non-winning branches can be kept for reference or deleted once the direction is clearly understood.

## Current State Overview

- Non-brand academic baseline: complete on `gendes-academia` branch
- Visual layer: palette, typography, article body, cards, footer, nav, and homepage sections are all at a quiet, stable first pass
- Transition system: card-to-detail and detail-to-card featured-media transitions working; fallback fade/slide working; timing tokens in `_motion-palette.scss`
- Static deploy: working end-to-end on Bunny CDN; Lighthouse 97
- Homepage content model: functional first pass; refinement spike preferred before gendes runs
- About page: frontend standalone; CMS-managed rewrite preferred before gendes runs
- Block coverage: all common block families covered at a first-pass visual quality

## To Do

### Hard Preparation

- Confirm the baseline branch runs locally in SSR without major rendering errors
- Confirm the static generation path still works after the current baseline, even if design branches are reviewed mainly in SSR
- Confirm mood-board media is kept local/ignored and organized by design branch under `docs/gendes-moodboard/<branch-name>/`

### Preferred Preparation

- Complete homepage content model refinement (`docs/scratch/homepage.md`) so the design branch works against real section structure
- Complete About page CMS migration (`docs/scratch/about-page.md`) so About is a real page with real content during review
- Complete copy cleanup (`docs/scratch/copy-cleanup.md`) — LLM placeholder text in a design branch review makes it hard to evaluate the actual design
- Confirm Side Projects page has at least a real empty-state before running a design branch

### Design Branch Workflow Setup

- Confirm the branch naming convention: `gendes-<direction>` branched from `gendes-academia`
- Use ordinary branch switching in this repo as the default comparison workflow
- Optionally document a `git worktree` workflow later if comparing multiple branches in separate folders becomes more comfortable
- Keep each design branch scoped to visual direction work so the winning branch can be merged back deliberately
- Merge the winning design branch back into the main working line after review and hand-tweaking, rather than manually copying the result file-by-file

### First Design Branch

- Create the branch: `git checkout -b gendes-<direction>` from `gendes-academia`
- Write the design brief in `docs/gendes-brief.md` — human-authored; specific enough to guide real decisions: what mood, what references, what this direction is not
- Assemble or generate a mood board in `docs/gendes-moodboard/<branch-name>/` — colors, textures, type pairings, layout references
- Give the agent the brief and mood-board inputs
- Let it implement the visual direction — palette, typography, surface treatments, card treatment, homepage sections, larger composition changes, and supporting SFC markup where useful
- Run `corepack pnpm check` — lint, typecheck, editor CSS rebuild; failures are blocking
- Review locally in SSR with `corepack pnpm start:frontend` at `http://my-website.localhost` across the review matrix below

### Expected Edit Scope

- Palette and token files under `packages/styles/`
- Shared-component recipes under `packages/styles/shared-components/`
- Scoped styles and supporting markup in Vue SFCs under `apps/frontend/components/`
- Route/page styles where a direction needs a page-level composition change
- Homepage/archive/card/detail composition changes when the branch needs more than a theme-variable pass
- Avoid CMS schema, GraphQL query shape, block registry changes, deploy scripts, Docker infrastructure, static publishing behavior, and seeded content unless a real rendering bug blocks the design branch

### Review Matrix

- Home desktop and mobile: hero, Selected Work, Latest Writing, Side Projects, About/CTA surfaces, footer
- Writing archive desktop and mobile: cards, load-more behavior, empty and long-list feel
- Writing detail: article rhythm, headings, text blocks, media, code, quote/pullquote, lists, table, embeds, audio/video, file/download, details/accordion — use the block QA fixture post at `/writing/block-qa-kitchen-sink-post`
- Case-study detail: featured media transition, hero, content-flow rhythm, bottom previous/next navigation — the block QA case study at `/case-studies/block-qa-kitchen-sink-case-study` covers the full block range
- About page or placeholder: whether the direction can handle an identity-heavy page
- Side Projects page or empty-state: whether secondary work has a coherent surface
- Keyboard/focus states, reduced motion, color contrast, link affordances, and hover/touch parity
- Static generation smoke test before a winner is merged

## Ready for Human Visual QA

_(Move design branches here when they are implemented and running locally in SSR, but not yet reviewed and decided on.)_

---

## Done

- Non-brand academic baseline — palette, typography, article body, cards, footer, nav, homepage sections
- Static CDN deploy with Lighthouse 97
- Card-to-detail, detail-to-card, and detail-to-detail featured-media transitions
- Transition timing tokens in `_motion-palette.scss`, JS reads CSS custom properties
- `docs/visual-design.md` documents the baseline visual direction
